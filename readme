1. Disclaimer
-------------

We are not liable for any damage caused by the use of this program.

In this version of the driver there is no support of TV,
only reception of data.

2. Installation
---------------

This driver requires source kernel to compile.

#cd /usr/ports/net/skystar2
#make install clean

This will put the binary in /usr/local/bin and config in
/usr/local/etc/

To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the skystar2
kernel module, by doing
# kldload skystar2
or adding
skystar2_load="YES"
to your /boot/loader.conf.

3. Adjustment and use
---------------

3.1 Dvbnet
--------------------

At first it is necessary to create the device and to be 
adjusted on PID the satellite provider.

# dvbnet -p 402
Status: device dvb0 for pid 402 created successfuly

After that there should be a device dvb0.

Options:
--------
-a[num] adapter
-p[pid] create if with pid
-d[num] del if by number
-l show list pids

3.2 Dvbtune
--------------------

Now it is necessary configure a card on other parameters of reception 
of our signal satellite provider. (frequency, polarization, speed of a stream etc).
For this purpose the file /usr/local/etc/channels.conf is necessary.

# cd /usr/local/etc/
# cp channels.conf.dist channels.conf

Adjustments represent a text line with parameters divided by a colon.

name:frequency:polarization:fec:sat_no:symbolrate:inv:

frequency: MHz
polarisation: h,v
fec: 1/2,2/3,3/4,5/6,7/8,auto
sat_no: switch to LNB number 0...4
symbolrate:
inv:   spectral inversion auto,on,off

SkyDSL:11481:h:7/8:0:41250:0:0:0

SkyDSL - the name. The name Perhaps, for example my_provider
11481 - frequency 
v - polarization is simple.
7/8 - FEC
41250 - Speed of a stream (Symbol rate)

# dvbtune -c /usr/local/etc/channels.conf -x -n1

Options:
--------
-h, -? help config
-a[num] adapter
-l list channel
-n[num] channel number
-c[file name] config file
-m monitor
-x exit after tuning


3.3 Monitor
--------------

To look a level and capture of a signal it is possible by means of the utility monitor

# monitor
